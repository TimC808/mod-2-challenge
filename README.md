1. Title - Portfolio Website of Timothy D. Connelly
2. Project Description - This website is designed to provide the end user with a solid understanding of the web development capabilities of me, Timothy D. Connelly. All of the creative work provided on this site has been developed by me unless otherwise specifically noted. I developed the initial version of this website using only HTML and CSS as part of a BootCamp course I enrolled in. It provides information about me and links to present and future creative work I've developed in an effort to give the end user, who may be any person with interest, including a prospective employer, a very good idea of my skills and abilities in web development.
3. Table of Contents - As of Monday, March 6, 2023 the page has one splash page and links to other placeholder pages that will be developed at a later date.
4. How to Install and Run the Project - No installation required. Just open in a web browser.
5. How to Use the Project - Simply open the Index.html file in your preferred web browswer and have fun!
6. Credits - In addition to the excellent instruction provided during the Edx bootcamp course I am enrolled in, I will also give credit to w3schools.com for their easy to search and understand instructions on HTML, CSS and JS commands.
7. Add a License - MIT license used through GITHUB.
8. Badges - TBD
9. How to Contribute to the Project - TBD
10. Tests - TBD
11. Project inspiration - Well, it was required for my course, but I was still inspired! Here is the acceptance criteria I used in order to ensure I met the minimum requirements of the project:

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
