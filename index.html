          <p id="aboutme">
            After over 30 years of serving in military and civilian leadership
            positions, I'm answering a calling I felt I've always missed in
            coding and web development. While I am highly adept at leading teams
            and projects, organizing for success, developing executable
            strategies, mitigating risk, and delivering results and
            profitability, I grew up in a period of significant transition that
            saw the birth of personal computers in the home and this thing
            called the internet. After I graduated from undergrad college, I
            would occassionally find a computer at work, but most work was still
            recorded with a pen or typewriter and a piece of paper. That aside,
            I am a proven leader of leaders skilled in talent management, human
            resources, logistics, sales and marketing and a growing set of Full
            Stack Web Development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL,
            Github and other technologies. My goal is to venture in to the world
            of technology with a high degree of technical credibility while
            bringing significant strategic insights and experience to the table.

        <h3 class="center-text">Things People Ask Me</h3>

        <p id="faq">
          Q: Where are you from?
          <br />
          A: Having been raised in a nomadic family, I am from both nowhere and
          everywhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          Q: Where have you been stationed in the military?
          <br />
          A: I am not authorized to disclose such information.
          <br />
          <br />
          Q: What's a triathlon?
          <br />
          A: If you don't know, then it's best to understand that it's an
          exercise in personal torture and suffering that, upon conclusion,
          provides some degree of emotional escalation, the type of which
          depends on how the event concluded.
